# passport-graphql-minimal-example
This is a minimal example illustrating the problems I have setting up a passport session with a client and a GraphQL server.

## Setting up the project
Create the postgres database database_development.

Then install the node modules like this:
```
npm i && cd client && npm i && cd ..
```

After that you can start the project with 
```
npm start
```
